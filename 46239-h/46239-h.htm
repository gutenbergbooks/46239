<p class="p2"><i>When I remember
(gentle Maister Rogers)
the auncient acquaintance
and friendship,
and the daylie and
accustomed metings, recourse
and familiaritie
that (am&#x14d;g the rest) did
happen and passe betwene vs in times past, in those
our yong and tender yeares, and in those famous
places of studie, vnto the which we were by oure
friendes appointed and then sent for learning sake.
And when moreouer, I doe remember, waye, and
c&#x14d;sider therin on the one side, that state and condition
of life, in the which I was then, with that,
which for my part on the other side, I doe now find
and haue long since felt and tasted of, I cannot but
recken and thinke that time most happily passed
which I bestowed in the trauaile and study of good
letters. For besides the inestimable fruit, &amp; the incomparable
pleasure &amp; delectation, that the Muses
doe bring vnto the studious, beside the sweete
rest of minde, voyde of all worldly cares and troubles,
the faire &amp; pleasaunt walkes, which we there
(with a number of vertuous, and well disposed,
and a sort of learned, ciuill, friendly and faithfull
companions) enioyed, togither with the wholesome
and cleane diet, not infected with outragious
or any surfetings (a vice else where to much vsed)
what honest and godly exercises had we then there
to the furtherance and increase of vertue, &amp; to the
abandoning of vice? insomuch that in a maner it
hath fared with me euer since my departing thẽce,
as with one that being expelled and exuled from a
second Paradise, replenished and adorned with all
kinde of flagrant &amp; of most wholesome and sweete
flowers and delights, is presently fallen as it were
into a darke &amp; an yrkesome thicket of bushes and
brambles of the cares and troubles of this worlde,
daylie readie, not onely to molest and perturbe the
quiet studious minde, but also so complete with an
infinite number of displeasures, dammages, and
daungers on euerye side that (verye much according
to the auncient and wonted prouerbe) I may
now iustly say</i> vix fugiet Scyllam, qui vult
vitare Charybdim. <i>Wherefore that mans
saying seemed not altogither voyde of reason, that
sayde, that if there were anye choyse to be had as
touching the estate of man, the better parte and
the first thereof was not to be borne at al, the next
vnto that was to die verie shortly. And yet by
the way neuerthelesse, as he that hath bene once in
any suche kinde of Paradise or place of pleasure, as
is aforesaide, hath alwayes nowe and then some
motions and occasions, to cast his sorrowfull eye
with a mournfull minde towardes the same: euen
so I of late beholding and lamenting that chaunged
place and state of life, and in the meane season
pervsing some pieces of mine olde exercises
which I had then and did there (whereof I was
alwayes bolde partly to make you priuie, as one
among all others whose discreete iudgement and
towardnesse in learning togither with the great
curtesie and singuler humanitie and friendship,
and the passing readie and great pleasantnesse of
wit, ioyned therewith was then certes not a little
had in admiration and embraced euery where)
happily I founde certaine loose papers of two Dialogues
of the famous and excellent Clarke</i> Erasmus
<i>of</i> Roterodame, <i>by me translated into
englishe (partly for the pleasantnesse of the matter,
as it seemed vnto me then, partly also for the
proofe and triall of my selfe what I coulde doe in
translating, and lastly as the matter semed swete
and pleasaunt, so not altogither voide of godlye
and wholesome exhortations and lessons, for all
sortes no lesse necessarie than profitable). Which
when I had with earnest view pervsed, and hauing
in minde diuers times to gratifie your goodnesse
with some friendly token of remembraunce,
forthwith I thought (renuing my wõted exercises)
to dedicate these two Dialogues vnto you. Whose
knowledge and learning I know, and gentlenesse
therwithal to be such, that I am in an assured hope
that (vntill I may giue better) ye will vouchsafe
in the meane season thankefully to accept these my
recreations, and these few lines at my handes as a
pledge and a poore present of the continuall remembrance,
and the vnfeyned good will I beare
towards you, &amp; your vertuous demerites. Wherin
notwithstanding, albeit peraduenture the exercise
of study and learning, and especially the matter
it selfe therein contained maye seeme to bee of
very small importance or pleasure, &amp; rather otherwise
different or something disagreeable vnto
your vocation on euerie side, and also vnto all
such for the most part as in the roome and place
of armes, are called towardes the seruice of the
Princes Maiestie, and of their Countrie</i> (Rara
enim inter Arma &amp; literas vel togas est
amicitia vel societas) <i>Yet I knowing the
great reuerence and the singular regard and estimation
that you do beare, and alwayes haue borne
towardes the learned and towardes good letters,
for the pleasant and fruitefull knowledge that you
your selfe haue most happily and with great dexteritie
both reaped and tasted among them in
times past, I doubt not but that (waying the worthinesse
of the Author of them, and accepting the
faithfull indeuours of me the rude translator of
them) you will be content to permit the same to
passe vnder your wing, and so much (I know) the
rather for that they both doe tende to vertues purpose.
The one of them being betweene a Woer and
his Feere, wherein albeit the naturall ouerthwartnesse
of the womanishe minde, doth now and then
burst out as out of the frayler and weaker vessell,
yet is therein a godlye kinde of woeing without
any scurilitie, very pleasantly, liuely, and plainly
declared and set forth, to the good behauiour and
honest inducement and furtherance of such as are
yet to take that matter or enterprise in hand, farre
from prouoking any vice, as the maner and guise
of a number of lasciuious Louers and fayned
woers nowe a dayes is, whose craftie and counterfet
dealings, fonde iestures and motions, and vncomely
and vaine communications and ydle talks
is better to be passed ouer with silence than paper
to be stained therewith, or any time to bee spent
therein. The other is betweene a yong man and a
light Woman, who in times past had bene further
acquainted then honestie required, and hee
hauing bene absent from hir for a certaine space,
at last repaired to hir house, who after hir accustomed
maner and wont, beganne to entise
and allure him to their former follies, who perceyuing
hir purpose therein, discreetly and properly
perswaded hir by diuers and sundrie godly and
vertuous reasons to leaue and forsake that kinde
of life, as of all other most detestable, and in the
ende making hir thereby to loath hir frayle and
accustomed follies, bringeth hir vnto an honest
and chaste conuersation. Thus the effect of the
whole matter you haue in few words. Accept therfore
(I praye you) this my simple doing in good
part, weying my good will in the friendly Ballance
of your accustomed gentlenesse, which I trust shall
somewhat counterpaise the vnworthinesse of
this my so grosse and rude a translation
of so worthy a writer.</i></p>

<p class="center xlarge p4">To the Reader.</p>


<p class="p2">I have (Gentle
Reader) set foorth to thy
viewe, two Dialogues of
the Reuerende &amp; renowmed
Clarke <i>Erasmus Roterodamus</i>:
whose learning,
vertue, and authoritie is of sufficient
force to defend his doyngs. But bicause
I haue chaunged his eloquent stile, into
our English phrase: and thereby altered
his liuerie, and embased the perfite
grace of his Muse, I am compelled
to craue pardon of this my doings, consider
I beseeche thee (learned Reader)
that if it had still rested in that Noble
language wherein hee left it, although
thy knowledge had yelded thee greater
felicitie than this my trauaile can, yet
thousandes, which by this mine indeuour
may draw out some sweete sap of
these his pleasant and fruitfull doings,
might (thorow ignorance) haue wanted
thys peece of delyght. Therfore the offence
(if any be) is made to <i>Erasmus</i> a má
of that pacience in his lyfe, as I assure
my self that this my bold dealing with
him, can not a whit disquiet his ghost.
Harme to thee at all it can not bee, for
that I haue not digressed from mine
Author. Pleasant and profitable I hope
it will be to many of my country folks
whose increase in vertue I greatlye desire.
Then suffer mee I pray thee to rest
with thy quiet and thankfull iudgement:
whereby thou shalt vrge me to
attempt farther enterprise (perchance
to thy delight.) Thus assuring my selfe
of thy lawfull fauour, I rest voyde of
care of the vnlearneds reproche, if they
beyonde their skill shall couet to
chat. And wishing to thee thy
full delight in learning &amp;
to them increase of
knoweledge, I
bid you both
farewel.</p>

<h2 class="center xlarge p4">Pamphilus, the Louer,<br />
<span class="center xlarge"><i>Maria, the woman</i></span><br />
<span class="center medium">beloued.</span></h2>


<p class="p2">Good morrowe cruell,
good morrow ruthlesse, good
morrow (I say) thou stony
harted woman.<br />
<br />
<b>Maria.</b> I
wishe you the same againe
<i>Pamphilus</i> as often, and as muche as
you please. And by what name you lyke
best to be saluted. But in the meane while
it s&#233;emeth you haue forgotten my name,
my name is <i>Maria</i>.<br />
<br />
<b>Pamphilus.</b> It might
more rightlye haue b&#233;ene <i>Martia</i>.<br />
<br />
<b>Maria.</b>
And why so I bes&#233;ech you? what haue I
to doe with <i>Mars</i>?<br />
<br />
<b>Pamphilus</b>: For as
that God counteth it but a pastime to murther
and kill men, euen so doe you. Herein
yet more cruell then <i>Mars</i>, for you murther
him that hartily loueth you.<br />
<br />
<b>Maria.</b>
Good wordes I praye you, where is that
heape of deade bodies whom I have murthered?
where is the bloud of them which
by me are slaine?<br />
<br /><b>Pamphilus.</b> One lifelesse
bodye thou s&#233;est present wyth thine
eyes, if (pardie) thou seest me.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> What
saye you man? doe you both talke and
walke, and yet dead? I pray to God I neuer
m&#233;ete with ghostes more to be feared.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Thus thou makest but a laughing
matter of it. Nathelesse thou hast reft me
wofull creature my life, and more cruelly
doest murther me, than if thou should stab
me into the body with a weapon, for now
am I miserably torne and vexed with long
torments.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> Yea good Lord? tell mee
how manye women with childe haue lost
their fruite by meeting with you?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
Yet this pale wanne colour sheweth m&#233;e
to b&#233;e more bloudlesse than any shadowe.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> But this palenesse (thanked be God)
is died with some Violet colour, you are
euen so pale as a Chery waxing ripe, or a
Grape when he commeth to his purple
skin.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Thus with disdaine ynough
you mocke a man in state rather to be pittied.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Why in case you bel&#233;eue not
mee, take the Glasse, &amp; bel&#233;eue your owne
eyes.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> I woulde wishe no better
Glasse, neyther (I suppose) is there anye,
more cl&#233;ere, than that in which I presentlye
behold my selfe euen now.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> What
Glasse speake you off.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Marie euen
your owne eyes.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Duertharter: how
thou talkest alwayes lyke thy selfe, but
howe proue you your selfe to bee deade:
Doe ghostes &amp; shadowes use to eat meat:
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> They doe, but find no sauour therin,
no more doe I.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And what, what
doe they eate I praye?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Mallowes,
L&#233;ekes and Lupines.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> But you (I
hope) let not to eate Capons and Partriches.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> I graunt, howbeit I f&#233;ele no
more pleasure in eating them, than if I
should crashe vpon Mallowes, or B&#233;etes,
without Pepper, wine and vinegar.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
Alack for you good man, and yet you are
in m&#233;etely good lyking, &amp; do ghostes speake
also.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Euen as I doe with a Verye
pewling and faint voice.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> But not
long since, when I hearde you checking
with mine other suter, your voice was not
very fóeble pardie. Moreouer I bes&#233;ech you
tell me this, doe ghostes vse to walke; are
they clad in garments; doe they eftsoones
sl&#233;epe.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Yea more than all that,
they practise the acte of kinde, but after
their owne maner.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Now by the faith
of my bodye you are a pleasaunt trifler.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> But what will you saye, if I proue
this by substantiall and strong reasons (I
meane) my selfe to be dead, and you to be
a murtherer.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> God shylde that (friend
<i>Pamphile</i>) but let me heare your Sophistrie.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> First you wil graunt me this:
(I suppose) that death is naught else but a
seperation of the soule from the body.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
I graunt.<br />
<br /><b>Pamphilus.</b> But graunt it so y<sup>e</sup>
you reuoke and call it not back againe, afterwarde.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> No more I wyll.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
Secondly, you wil not denie but he which
reaueth the soule, wherein consisteth life,
is a murtherer.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I consent.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> You
will I am sure graunt me this lykewyse,
which most graue and credible Authors
haue affirmed, &amp; by the consent and iudgement
of all ages hath bene holden truth
and allowed, (I meane) that the soule of a
man is not where he liueth, but where he
loueth.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> You must vtter that after a
more grosse, and plaine sorte, for in good
faith I perceyue not your meaning.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
And I am the more sorie, and euill at ease,
bicause you doe not perceiue and f&#233;ele this
to be true, as well as I doe.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Make
me to feele it then.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> As well mightest
thou bid me, make an Adamant f&#233;ele it.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Now truely I am a yong wench, not
a stone.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Truth, but more harde yet
than the Adamant stone.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> But proc&#233;ede
with your argument.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Those
which are rapt in the spirite, or fallen into
a traunce (as they call it) neyther heare,
nor s&#233;e, nor smell, nor f&#233;ele any thing, no
though you would kil them.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Surely I
haue hard say so.<br />
<br /><b>Pa.</b> And what think you
to be the cause of this insensibilitie.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I
would learne that of you which are a Philosopher.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Bicause (pardie) the soule
or minde is in heauen, where it hath that
which it vehemently loueth, &amp; is not present
with the body.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And what is next?
what conclude you vpon this?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Askest
thou what O cruell? euen this necessarily
followeth, my selfe to be deade, and
thy selfe to b&#233;e a murtherer.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Why,
where is your soule become and God wil?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> There it is, where it loueth.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
And who hath reft it from you? why sigh
you man? speake and feare not, you shall
not be hindered by me.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> A certaine
cruell and pittilesse mayde, whome neuerthelesse
I cannot finde in my hart to hate,
being by hir spoyled of my life.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Ah,
a louing hart, ah gentle nature. But why
do you not againe take from hir, hir soule,
and serue hir as they saye, with the same
sause.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> The happiest in the worlde,
were I, if I could make that exchaunge (I
meane) that hir minde might come dwell
in my brest, in sorte as mine hath wholye
dwelled in hir body.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> But wil you giue
me leaue now eftsones a while to play the
Sophister his part with you?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Nay
the Sophistresse parte.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Is it possible
that one and the same bodie both haue the
soule and be without the soule.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Not
both togither or at one time.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> When
the soule is awaye, then the body (you say)
is deade.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Truth.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And it lyueth
not but when y<sup>e</sup> soule is present withall?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Be it so verily.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> How commeth
this to passe then, that y<sup>e</sup> soule being there
where it loueth, the body yet wherout it is
departed, neuerthelesse lyueth? for if it lyueth
in one place, when it loueth in an other,
by what reas&#x14d; is it called <i>Exanime Corpus</i>,
as you would say, a lifelesse body, since
it hath life and sense in it.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> By saint
Marie you playe the Sophistres meetelye
well, howbeit you cannot snarle me in
such chicken bandes. That soule which after
a sort gouerneth the bodye of a liuing
creature being in suche case is improperly
called the soule, for in very dede it is a certaine
small portion of the soule, which remaineth
behind, euen as the sauor of Roses
tarieth still in the hande of him, which
bare them, when y<sup>e</sup> very Roses themselues
be done away.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I s&#233;e well inough it is
hard to take a foxe in a pitch, but answere
me to this also. Is not he a doer which
murthereth.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> What else.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And is
not y<sup>e</sup> partie a sufferer, who is murthered?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Yes.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> How commeth it to passe
then, that since he which loueth is the doer
and sh&#233;e which is beloued is but the sufferer,
she should be infamed for a murtherer,
which is beloued. When as in verie d&#233;ede,
he that loueth rather murthereth himself?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Nay, it is contrarie, for he that loueth
suffreth, she that is beloued doth.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
That shall you neuer proue true with the
consent of our chiefe <i>Areopagites</i> of Grammer.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> But this will I proue true by
the consent of the whole Parliament of
Logitians.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> But aunswere me to this
againe, loue you with your wil, or against
your wyll?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> With my will.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b>
Ergo, sithence it is in fr&#233;e choise to loue, or
not to loue, whoso loueth, is a murtherer
of himselfe, and wrongfullye accuseth the
poore wench beloued.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Why? I say
not that the wench murthereth bicause she
is beloued, but bicause she loueth not againe
the party which loueth hir: for (truth
it is) she is guilty of murther, which might
saue a mans life and will not.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I put
case a yong man cast his loue vpon one,
which he ought not to loue, or maye not
lawfully obtaine, as an other man hys
wyfe, or a Virgine, which hath professed
continuall chastitie, shall she loue him againe,
so to preserue and saue hir louer?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> But this yong man loueth that,
which to loue is both lawfull and godly,
and standeth both with reason and equity,
and yet neuerthelesse is cast away. That
in case you set light by the crime of homicide,
I will aguilt you also of sorcerie and
enchaunting me.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Marrie gods forbod
man, what will you make of me a <i>Circes</i>
ympe, a witch?<br />
<br /><b>Pa.</b> Yea and somewhat
more cruell yet, than euer was <i>Circes</i>. For
I had rather be a groueling Hog or beare,
then as I am, without life or soule.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
And with what kinde of sorcerie I praye
ye doe I destroy men.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> By euill aspect.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Will you then that I hurt you
no more with loking vpon you?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Not
so for Gods sake, but rather looke more vpon
me.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> If mine eyes be witches, how
hapneth it then that other also do not consume
awaye, whome I looke vpon as ofte
as you, therfore I feare me much, y<sup>e</sup> bewitching
is in your owne eyes, not in mine.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Why thinke you it not inough to
flea <i>Pamphilus</i>, except you triumph ouer
him being dead.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> Oh queint handsome,
nise dead body: when shall your funerals
be prouided for.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Sooner than
you thinke ywisse, except you remedie in
time.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I remedie good Lord? am I
able to doe such a cure?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Yea surely:
all were I deade, it lyeth in you to rayse
me vp againe to life, and that with a light
thing.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> As you say, peraduenture I
might doe it, if some bodye woulde helpe
me to the herbe <i>Panaces</i>, wherevnto they
ascribe so great a vertue.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> There
needeth none herbes to doe it, only vouchsafe
to loue againe, what is more easie to
be perfourmed? nay rather what is more
due and iust? otherwise you shall neuer
acquite your selfe of manspilling.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b>
And before what iudgement seate shall I
be arrayned, before the seuere <b>Areopagetes</b>
and God will?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Not so, but before
the tribunall seate of <i>Venus</i>.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b>
Best of al, for they say she is a patient and
pitiful Goddesse.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Say you so, there
is not one amongst them all, whose wrath
is more to be feared.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Why, hath she
a thunderbolte?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> No.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> Hath
she a thr&#233;eforked mase like <i>Neptune</i>?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
Not so.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Hath she a speare as <i>Pallas</i>?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Neyther: but sh&#233;e is a Goddesse of
the Sea.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> I come not within hir
kingdome.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> But she hath a boye.
<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> I feare no boyes.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> He is readie
to reuenge, and will paye home when
he striketh.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And what shall he doe to
me?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> What shall he doe: the gods
fore let him. I will prognosticate none
euill vnto one, whome I beare good will.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Yet tell me I pray you, I will take
no conceit of it.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Then will I tell
you if you shall disdaine this louer, who
doubtlesse is not vnworthie your loue, verily
I beleue, that same boy (peraduenture
at the c&#x14d;maundement of his mother) wyll
thirle into your heart a launce embrued
with to bad a poyson, wherby you shal set
your affection miserably vppon some hoblout,
who shall not loue you any whit againe.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Marrie that were a plague in
d&#233;ede, of all other most to be detested. Certes
I had rather to die, than to be entangled
in the loue of one which is deformed, &amp;
could not finde in his hart to loue me likewise
againe.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> But it is not long
time, since there was a right notable example
of this euil, which I now speak off,
shewed in a certaine yong damzel.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> In
what place, and I may be so bold as to ask
you?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> At the Citie <i>Aurelia</i>.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
Howe many yeares ago?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Howe
many yeares, nay, it is scarse yet ten monethes.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And what was the Maydes
name? whereat sticke you?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Nothing.
I knewe hir as well as I knewe
you.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Why tell you me not hir name
then?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Bicause I like not the lucke
therof, I had rather she had had any other
name: She had euen the verie name that
you haue.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Who was hir father?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> He is yet man aliue, and amongst
the Lawyers is one of chiefe estimation,
and of substantiall welth.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Tell me
his name also.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> <i>Mauritius.</i><br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> His
surname.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> His surname was <i>Aglaus</i>.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Liueth the mother yet?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
She departed of late.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Of what disease
died sh&#233;e?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Of what disease,
quoth you, for m&#233;ere sorrow &amp; heauinesse.
And the father himselfe albeit he is a man
of a strong nature scaped very narowly.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And may I learne at your hand also
the name of the mother.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> With all
mine hart, who is he that knoweth not
<i>Sophrona</i>. But what meane you by this
questioning? Thinke you that I contriue
fables for you.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Why would I thinke
so, that is rather to be suspected in oure
kinde, but tell on, what befell vnto this
mayde.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> This damzell was come of
an honest stock (as I haue said) and wanted
no welth to hir preferment: for bewty
and shape of body, also goodly to beholde,
what needeth many words, she was well
worthy to haue lien by a Prince his side.
She had a wooer, who earnestly besought
hir good will, a man for personage &amp; bewtie
not vnlike hir self.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And what was
his name?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Alas, God blesse me from
the luck, hys name also was <i>Pamphilus</i>,
when he had done all that he could, and assayed
all waies possible to obtaine hir good
will, she still obstinately despised him. In
fine, the yong man pined away with sorrow,
and dyed. Not long after, this wench
beganne to dote vppon such a handsome
squire, as for his personage, I might more
rightly call an Ape than a m&#x101;.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> What
say you man?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> She was so farre fallen
in the brakes with him, that I am not
able to expresse.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> What, so proper a
wench with so vnsightly a p&#233;ece?<br />
<br />
<b>Pam.</b>
He had a head made like a sugar lofe, the
heare thereof growing as it were by stitches
and that knotted, vnkempt, full of
scurfe and nittes, and a good parte of hys
<span class="sidenote">Alopecia
<i>is a disease
that causeth
the
heare to
pill off</i>.</span>
scalpe was bared by the disease called <i>Alopecia</i>,
his eies sunk into his head, his nosethrils
wide &amp; turning vpwardes, a mouth
like an Ouen with rotten t&#233;eth, and a
stamering tongue, a scuruy beard, a hunch
backe, a belly like a tode, and legges as
right as a paire of horse h&#x101;mes.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Marry
sir you describe him to be a very <i>Thersites</i>?

<span class="sidenote"> Thersites
<i>a Prince,
that came

Greekes to
the siege of

and condicion

<br />
<br />
<b>Pam.</b> Nay besides al this, they say, he had
but one of his eares.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Peraduenture
he had lost the other in some battaile.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
No surely, euen in peace.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Who durst
be so bolde to doe that?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Who but
<i>Dionysius</i> that cutteth of eares at the Pillory.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Wel, it may be yet y<sup>e</sup> his substance
at home was such as made a full mendes
for all the deformitie that you haue spoken
of.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Nay surely: he had vnthriftilye
spent all, and ought more than hee was
worth, with this suchen an husbande doth
this so goodly a wench nowe lead hir life.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> You haue declared a thing much to
be pittied.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Surely it is true, the

<span class="sidenote"> Nemesis,
<i>the Goddesse
of
wrath or indignation</i>.</span>

Goddesse <i>Nemesis</i> woulde so haue it, that
the iniurie of the yong man, whome sh&#233;e
despised might be requited of hir.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I
would rather wish to be destroyed with a
thunderbolt out of hande, than to be yoked
with such a mate.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Therfore beware
how you prouoke this Ladie, who
reuengeth disdaine, and frame your harte
to loue him againe, who loueth you.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
If that may suffice (loe) I loue you again.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> But I craue that loue at your hand,
which should be perpetuall and to loue me
as your owne. I s&#233;eke a wife, not a friend.

<span class="sidenote"> Deliberandum
est diu,
quod statuendum
est semel.</span>

<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I know that well inough, but that
thing requireth long deliberation, and
much aduisement, which when it is done,
cannot be vndone againe.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> I haue
deliberated vppon it to long for my part.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Well (I r&#233;ede you) take h&#233;ede, least
loue who is not the best counseller beguile
you, for men say that loue is blinde.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
Nay, that loue hath eyes which springeth
vpon iudgement: I doe not therfore take
you to be such a one as you are, bicause I
loue you: but I loue you for that I plainly
s&#233;e you to be such a one.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Beware
I say, you mistake me not, you maye b&#233;e
ouers&#233;ene, if you had worne the shoe,
then you shoulde perceyue where it wringeth.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> I must put it in a venture, although
by many good tokens I conceyue a
hope of better lucke.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Whye, are you
skilfull in signes and tokens, are you become
an Augur?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Yea marry am I.

<span class="sidenote"> <i>Augurs

which by

<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> By what Augurall signes I praye
you, do you coniecture that it shal be thus?
hath the night Crowe taken hir flight before
you?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> She flieth for fooles.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
What, haue you s&#233;ene a cowple of Dooues
come flying towardes you on the right
hande?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> No such thing, but I haue
knowne for the space of certaine yeares
the verteous and honest behauiour of your
parents, that is a birde not least to be regarded
(I think) to be come of a good stock.
Moreouer, I am not ignorant with what
wholesome instructions, and verteous examples
you haue bene traded and brought
vp by them. And truely good education is
of more effect than good Parentage. This
is an other signe which moueth me to conceyue
a good hope, beside this, betwene my
parents, which I hope I n&#233;ede not to be ashamed
of and yours, haue (as I suppose)
bene, no smal loue and friendship. Yea we
our selues from our biggens (as they say)
haue bene brought vp togither, &amp; not much
vnlike one vnto another in nature and disposition.
Now our age, substance, estimation,
and bloude are as well betw&#233;ene vs
two, as betw&#233;ene both our parentes in a
maner equall. Lastly that which in friendship
is the chiefe thing, your maners s&#233;emeth
not the worste to square vnto my
minde and liking, for it maye bee that a
thing is simply and of it selfe right excellent
and yet not apt and m&#233;ete for some
vse. How my maners frameth vnto your
minde againe I knowe not. These, these
be the birdes (my Ioy) which putteth mee
in an assured hope, that a coniunction
betw&#233;ene vs two, shall be right ioyfull,
pleasant, stable, &amp; sw&#233;ete, so that you could
finde in your hart to sing that song, which
I so much desire to beare.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> What
song is that you would haue me to sing.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> I will teach you the tune therof.

<span class="sidenote"> <i>I am thine.
<br />
Be thou
mine.</i></span>

<i>Sum tuus</i>, say you againe, <i>Sum tua</i>.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
The song in d&#233;ede is short, but me thinks
it hath a verie long ende, and much matter
dependeth thereon.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> What forceth
it for the length, so it be pleasant &amp; sw&#233;ete
vnto you.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I loue you so well that I
woulde not haue you doe that, whereof you
should herafter repent &amp; beshrew your self.
<br />
<br /><b>Pa.</b> I pray you neuer speake of any repentance.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Peraduenture you shoulde otherwise
esteme of me, when eyther age or
sicknesse shall chaunge this fourme or fauour.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Why? this body of myne (O
my d&#233;ere) shall not alwayes continue in
this estate, thus prest and lustie, but I respect
not so muche this flourishing and
bewtifull house, as I doe him that dwelleth
therein.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> What meane you by
that you speak of him that dwelleth within?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Verily, I meane your well disposed
and vertuous minde, whose beawtie
alwayes encreaseth with age. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> What,
your sight is yet more pleasant than <i>Linx</i>,
if you can espie that, through so many couerings.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Yea certes with my mind
I doe right well espie your minde: moreouer
(I saye) in those children which God
shall sende vs, w&#233;e shall as it were, ware
yong againe.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> But in the meane
time virginitie is lost.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Truth, in
good faith, tell me if you had a goodly orchyarde
plat, whether woulde you with nothing
should therein grow but blossomes,
or else had you rather (the blossomes fallen
awaye) beholde your tr&#233;es fraught and laden
with pleasaunt fruite? <br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> Howe
sliely he reasoneth.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> At the least aunswere
me to this: whether is it a better
sight for a Vine to lye vppon the grounde
and rot, or the same to embrace a poale, or
an elme, and lode it full with purple grapes?
<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> Now sir aunswere me to this
againe, whether is it a more pleasant sight
a Rose trim and milkewhite, yet growing
on his stalk, or the same plucked with
the hande, and by little and little withering
awaye?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Certes in mine opinion
the rose is the happiest, and commeth
to the better ende, which withereth and dieth
in the hande of man, delighting in the
meane while both the eies and nosethrils,
than thother which withereth on the bush,
for there muste it n&#233;edes wither also at
length, euen as that wine hath better luck
which is drunken, than that which standeth
still, and is turned into vinigar. And
yet the flowring beautie of a woman doth
not decay forthwith as soone as she is maried,
for I knowe some my selfe, who before
they were maried, were pale colored,
faint, and as it were pined away, who by
the friendly felowship of an husband, haue
wared so faire, and welfauoured, that you
would think they neuer came to the flower
of their beautie till then.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> But for
all your saying, virginity is a thing much
beloued and lyked with all men. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> I
graunt you, a yong woman, a virgine, is a
fayre, &amp; goodly thing, but what by course of
kind is more vnseemly th&#x101; an old wrinkled
maide: Had not your mother bene contented
to lose that flower of hir virginitie,
surely we had not had this flower of your
beautie. So that in case (as I hope) our
mariage be not barren, for the losse of one
virgine we shall paye God manye. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
But they saye chastitie is a thing wherein
God is much delighted.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> And therefore
doe I desire to couple my selfe in mariage
with a chast mayden, that with hir I
may leade a chaste life. As for our mariage
it shall rather be a mariage of our minds,
than of our bodies, we shall increase vnto
Christ, we shall increase vnto the c&#x14d;mon
welth. How little shall this matrimonie
differ fr&#x14d; virginitie? &amp; peraduenture hereafter
we shall so liue togither, as blessed
Marie liued with Joseph, no man cometh
at the first to perfection. <br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> What is
that I heard you say euen now, must virginity
be violated and lost, therby to learn
chastitie? <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Whye not, euen as by
drinking of wine moderately, we learn by
little and little to forbeare wine vtterlye,
which of these two seemeth vnto th&#233;e to be
more temperat, he that sitting in the mids
of many daintie dishes, abstaineth from
them all, or he which forbeareth intemperauncie,
hauing none occasi&#x14d; to moue him
vnto the same? <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I suppose him to haue
the more confirmed habite of temperance
whom plentie alwayes prest can not corrupt.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Whether deserueth more
the prayse of chastitie, he that geldeth him
selfe, or he which k&#233;eping his members all
and sounde abstaineth from all womans
companie? <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Verily by my consent the
latter shal haue the praise of chastitie, that
other of mad follie.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Why? those
which by vowe haue abiured matrimonye
doe they not after a sort gelde themselues?
<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> Verily it s&#233;emeth so.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Thus
you s&#233;e, it is no vertue to forbeare womens
companie.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> Is it no vertue?
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Marke me this, if it were simplye a
vertue to forbeare the companie of a woman,
then shoulde it be also a vice to vse
the companie of a woman, but sometime
it befalleth that it is sin to refuse the acte,
and a vertue to vse it.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> In what case
is it so?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> In case the husband requireth
of his wife the debt of marriage, euen
so often as he shall do it, especially if he requireth
it for the desire of generation. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
But what if he be fleshfond and wanton,
may she not lawfully denie it him?<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
She maye admonish him of his fault and
rather gently perswade him to bridle hys
affections, to giue him a flat nay when he
straineth vpon hir, she may not. Albeit I
here verie fewe men complaine of their
wyfes vncurtesie this way.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Yet m&#233;e
thinks libertie is sw&#233;ete. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Nay rather
virginitie is a heauie burthen. I shall
be to you a King, and you shall be to me a
Qu&#233;ene. And eyther of vs shall rule the
familie, as we thinke good, take you thys
to be a bondage? <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> The common sort
calleth mariage an halter. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Now on
my fayth they are well worthie an halter
that so termeth it. Tell me I praye you
is not your soule bounde vnto your body?
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I thinke so. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Yea surely euen as
a bird vnto hir cage, &amp; yet if ye should aske
him the question, whether he would b&#233;e
loosed or no, I suppose he would saye nay.
And why so? bicause he is willinglie and
gladlie bounde therevnto.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> We haue
little to take to neither of vs both. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
So much the lesse indaungered to fortune
are wee, that little you shall encrease at
home wyth sauing, which as they counteruayleth
a great reuenue, and I abroad
with diligence. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> An houshold of children
bringeth innumerable cares. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
On the other side agayne, the same children
bringeth infinite pleasures, and oftentimes
requiteth the parentes naturall
paines to the vttermost, with great ouerplusse.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Then to lead a barren life in
marriage is a great miserie. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Why
are you not now barraine? tell me whether
had ye rather neuer be borne, or borne
to die. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Certes I had rather be borne
to die.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> So that barrainnesse is yet
more miserable which neyther hadde, nor
shall haue child, euen as they be more happie
which haue alreadie lyued, then they
which neuer haue, nor shall hereafter be
borne to liue. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> And what be those, I
praye you which neyther are, nor shall be.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> For he that cannot finde in his hart
to suffer and abide the chaunges, &amp; chaunces,
whervnto all we indifferently be subiect,
as well men of poore estate, as Kings,
&amp; Emperours, he is not to dwell here, let
him get him out of this worlde. And yet,
whatsoeuer shal mischaunce vnto vs two,
yours shoulde be but the one halfe thereof,
the greater parte I will alwaies take vnto
mine owne selfe. So that if anie good
thing doe happen vnto vs oure pleasure
shall be dubble if anye euill betide vs, you
shall haue but the one halfe of the griefe,
and I the other. As for my selfe, if God so
woulde, it were vnto me a pleasure, euen
to ende my life in your armes. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Men
can better sustaine and beare with y<sup>t</sup> which
chaunceth according to the common course
and rule of nature. For I s&#233;e that some parentes
are more troubled wyth their childrens
euill manners, than with their naturall
deathes. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> To preuent such
misfortune, that it happen not vnto vs, it
resteth for the most part in our power.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
How so? <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> For commonly parentes,
which b&#233;e good and vertuous, haue good &amp;
vertuous children, I meane as concerning
their natural disposition, for doues do not
hatch Puthockes: wherefore we will first
indeuour to b&#233;e good our selues, and oure
next care shall b&#233;e, that our children may
euen from the mothers brest, be seasoned
with vertuous counsails, and right opinions,
for it skilleth not a little what licour
you poure into a newe vessell at the first.
Finallye, we shall prouide that they may
haue euen at home in our house a good example
of lyfe to followe. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Harde it is
to bring that to passe that you say.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>

<span class="sidenote"> Difficiliaque
pulchra.
<i>Godly
things be
harde.</i></span>

No maruaile, for commendable, and good
it is. And for that also are you harde to
b&#233;e entreated and wonne, the more deficile
and harde it is, the more good will
and indeuour shall w&#233;e put there vnto.
<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b> You shall haue m&#233;e a matter
soft and plyant, s&#233;e you y<sup>t</sup> you do your part
in forming and shaping me as you ought.
<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> But in the meane while saye those
thr&#233;e wordes which I require of you. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
Nothing were more easie for me to doe,
but wordes be wynged, and when they be
flowen out once doe not retire, I will tell
you what were a better way for vs both.
You shall treate with your Parentes and
myne, and with their will and consent let
the matter be concluded. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Ah you set
me to wooe againe, it is in you, with thr&#233;e
words to dispatch the whole matter.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
Whether it lyeth in m&#233;e so to doe (as you
say) I knowe not, for I am not at liberty.
And in olde time mariages were not concluded
without the will &amp; consent of their
parents or elders. But howsoeuer the case
be, I suppose our mariage shall b&#233;e the
more luckie, if it be made by the authoritie
of our parents. And your part it is to seke
and craue the good will, for vs to doe it, it
were vns&#233;emelye: virginite would s&#233;eme
alwayes to be taken with violence, yea
though sometime we loue the partie most
earnestly. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> I wil not let to s&#233;eke their
good will, so that I may alwayes be in an
assurance of your consent.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> You n&#233;ede
not doubt thereof, be of good ch&#233;ere (my
<i>Pamphile</i>) <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> You are herein more
scrupulus yet then I woulde wish you to
be.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Nay marie, waye, and consider
you well with your selfe, before, whervnto
you haue set your minde and will. And
do not take into your counsaile, this blind
affection borne towardes my person, but
rather reason, for that which affection decerneth
is liked for a reas&#x14d;, but that which
reason auiseth is neuer mislyked.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
Certes thou speakest like a wittie wench;
wherefore I intende to followe thy counsayle.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> You shall not repent you thereof,
but how he sirha there is now fallen into
my minde a doubt, which vexeth m&#233;e
sore.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Away with all such doubtes
for Gods sake.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Why will you haue
me marry my selfe to a dead man. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b>
Not so, for I will reuiue againe.<br />
<br /><b>Maria.</b>
Now, loe you haue voided this doubt, fare

<br /><b>Ma.</b> I pray God
giue you a good night, why fetch you such

<br /><b>Pam.</b> A good night say you?
I woulde to God you would vouchsafe to
giue me that, which you wishe mee. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b>
Soft and faire, I pray you your haruest is
as yet but in the greene blade. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Shall
I haue nothing of yours wyth me at my
departure.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Take this Pomander to
ch&#233;ere your harte wyth.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Yet giue
me a kisse withal I pray thee.<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I would
k&#233;epe my virginitie whole, and vndefiled
for you.<br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Why doth a kisse take ought
away from your virginitie? <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> Would
you thinke it well done that I shoulde be
fr&#233;e of kisses vnto other men. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> Nay
marrie I would haue my kisses spared for
my selfe. <br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> I keepe them for you then.
And yet there is an other thing in y<sup>e</sup> way,
which maketh me that I dare not at thys
time giue you a kisse. <br />
<br /><b>Pam.</b> What is that.
<br />
<br /><b>Ma.</b> You saye that your soule is alreadie
gone well n&#233;ere altogither into my body,
and a very small parte thereof taryeth behinde
in your owne, so that I feare in time
of a kisse, that which remayneth might
happen to sterte out after it, &amp; then were
you altogither without a soule. Haue you
therefore my right hande in token of mutuall
loue, and so fare you well. Go you
earnestly about your matters. And I for
my part in the meane while, shall pray
vnto Christ, that the thing which
you do, may be vnto the ioy
and felicitie of vs
both. Amen</p>

<h1>Of the yong man and the<br />
<i>euill disposed woman</i>.</h1>




<p class="center p2"><b>Lucrecia.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sophronius.</b></p>


<p class="p2">Iesu mercy my olde louing
Frynde <i>Sophronius</i>,
are you at length come againe
vnto vs? nowe mee
thinkes you haue beene awaye
euen a worlde space,
Truelye at the first blushe I scarce knewe
you.<br />
<br /><b>Sophronius.</b> And why so myne olde
acquanintaunce <i>Lucres</i>? <br />
<br /><b>Lucres.</b> Why so?
bicause at your departing you had no berd
at al, now you become a handsome beardling.
But what is the matter my sweete
harte: for me thinks you are waxed more
sterne and graue countenaunced then to
fore you had wont. <br />
<br /><b>Sophronius.</b> I would
gladly talke with you friendlye in some
place aparte from all companye.<br />
<br /><b>Lucres.</b>
Why are we not here alone (my luste?)
<br />
<br /><b>Sophronius.</b> No, let vs go our selues into
some place yet more secret and priuie. <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b>
Be it so, let vs go into my inwarde chamber,
if ought you list to doe. <br />
<br /><b>Sophronius.</b>
Yet mee thinketh this place is not close &amp;
secret ynough. <br />
<br /><b>Lucres.</b> Why? whence
comes this new shamefastnesse vpon you.
I haue a Closet wherein I lay vp my Iewels
and array, a place so darke that vnneth
the one of vs shall see the other. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b>
Looke round about it, if there be any crany
or rifte. <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Here is not a cranye nor
rifte to be seene.<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Is there no body neere
that mought listen and here vs? <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> No
verily not a flie (my ioy) why doubt you?
Why go you not about your purpose?<br />
<br /><b>So.</b>
Shall wee here beguile the eies of God?
<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Not so, for he seeth thorow all things?
<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Or shall wee be out of the sight of his
Aungels? <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Neyther, for no bodie can
hide him out of their sight. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> How happeneth
it then, that we be not ashamed to
doe that before the eies of God, and in the
presence of his holy Aungels, which wee
woulde be ashamed to doe in the syght of
men?<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> What a strange thing is this,
came you hither to preache? put yee on,
one of Saint Francis cowles, and get ye
vp into the Pulpit, and let vs heare you
there my yong Beardling.<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Neither
would I thinke it much so to doe, if by that
meane I might call you backe from thys
kind of life, not only most foule &amp; shameful,
but also most miserable. <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> And why
so good sir? I must get my liuing one way
or other, euery man liueth and is maintained
by his craft, &amp; science, this is our trade
our lands and reuenues.<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> I would to
God (good friende <i>Lucres</i>) that you, voyding
for a while this dronkennesse of the
mynde, coulde finde in your heart rightly
to ponder and consider with me, the thing
as it is.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Keepe your sermond till an
other time, nowe let vs take our pleasure
(my good friende <i>Sophronie</i>).<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> All that
you doe, you doe it for lucre and gaines I
am sure. <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Therin you haue gone nere
the marke. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Well, you shall loose no parte
of that, which you make your accompt
vppon, I will giue you euen foure
times as much onely, to lend me your attentiue
care.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Say on then euen what
you please. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> First aunswere me to this.
Haue you any that beareth you euill wil?
<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Mo then one. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> And are there not
some againe, whome you hate likewise?
<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Euen as they deserue at my hande.
<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Now if it lay in thee to pleasure them
wouldest thou in faith do it? <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Nay sooner
woulde I giue them their bane. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b>
Verie well, consider now, consider I saye
whither ought thou mayest doe to them
more pleasaunt and better lyked, then to
let them see thee leade this maner of lyfe,
so shamefull and wretched. On the other
side, what canst thou do more to the griefe
and misliking of them, which be thy verye
friendes in deede? <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Such was my lot,
and destinie. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Moreouer, that which is
compted to be the most harde, and heauie
happe of those which are cast out into Ilands,
or banished vnto the people most inhumaine
and barbarous, the same haue
you of your owne free will, and election,
taken vnto your selfe.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> And what is
that? <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Hast not thou of thine accorde
renounced &amp; forsaken all naturall affections
and loues, your father, mother, brethren,
sistrene, aunt, great aunt, &amp; whomsoeuer
beside nature hath linked vnto thee
for they in verye deede, are full euill ashamed
of thee, and thou darest not once come
into their sight.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Naye marrye, mee
thinkes I haue luckilye chaunged myne
affectes, in that for a few louers, nowe I
haue won me verie many, among whome
you are one, whome I haue accompted off
as my naturall brother.<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Let passe this
light accustomed talke, &amp; way the matter
as it is, in earnest. And first beleeue mee
this (my <i>Lucres</i>) shee that hath so many
louers, hath no loue at all. They that resort
vnto thee, doe not take thee for their
loue, but rather for their luste, see howe
thou hast debased thy selfe wretched Woman.
Christ helde thee so deere, that hee
vouchsafed to redeeme thee with his most
precious bloud, to the ende, thou mightest
partake with him in his heauenlye kingdome.
And thou makest thy selfe a cõmon
Gonge, or muckhill wherevnto fowle and
filthy, scalde, and scuruie, doth at their
pleasure resort, to shake off their filth and
corruption. That if thou be yet free and
not infected wyth that lothsome kinde of
leprie, commonly called the french pockes,
assure thy selfe thou cannot long be wythout
it. Which if it chaunce thee to haue,
what in more miserable and wretched case
then thou, yea, though other things were
as thou wouldst wish (I meane) thy substance
and fame, what shalt thou then be,
but a lump of quick carraine: you thought
it a great matter to be obedient vnto your
mother, now you liue in seruitude, vnder
a filthie bawde. It went to your heart to
heare the good aduertisements of your father,
here you must often tymes take in
good parte, euen the stripes of dronkardes,
and madbraines, you coulde awaye with
no maner of worke, when you were with
your friendes, to helpe towardes your lyuing,
but in this place what trouble, what
continuall watcking are you faine to sustaine?
<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> From whence (and God will)
coms this new prating preacher. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Now
I praye thee, haue this also in thy minde.
The flower of beautie, which is the baite
that allureth men to loue thee, in shorte
time it shall fade, and decaye. And what
shalt thou then doe, vnhappie creature,
what donghill shall be more vile, and vnregarded
than thou then? than loe, thou
shalt of an hoore, become a bawde, yet euery
one of you commeth not vnto that promotion,
but if that befalleth thee, what is
more abhominable, or nerer reprocheth euen
to the wicked occupacion of the deuill.
<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Truth it is in good faith, <i>Sophronie</i> in
a maner all that you haue hitherto sayde.
But howe commeth this newe holinesse
vpon you, who were wont to be amongst
all the little goods, yet one of the least, for
no man repaired hither, eyther oftener or
at more vntimely howres, than your self?
I heare say you haue beene at Roome latelie.
<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> I haue so in deede.<br />
<br /><b>Lucres.</b> Why
men are wont to come from thence worse
than they went thither. How happeneth
the contrarie to you? <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> I will tell you,
bycause I went not to Rome, with that
minde, and after that sort, other commonlie
goe to Rome, euen of set purpose to retourne
woorse, &amp; so doing they want none
occasions when they come there, to be as
they purposed. But I went thither in the
companie of an honest vertuous man, by
whose aduise, in steede of a bibbing bottel,
I caried with me, a handsome little booke
the new testament of <i>Erasmus</i> translation.
<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Of <i>Erasmus</i>? And they saye he is an
heretike and an halfe. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Why hath the
name of that man come hither also?<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b>
None more famous with vs.<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Haue
you euer seene his persone? <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Neuer,
but in good fayth I woulde I might, bycause
I haue hearde so much euill of hym.
<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Perhaps of them that be euill themselues.
<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Nay truely, euen of reuerend
personages. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> What be they. <br />
<br /><b>Lucres.</b>
I may not tell you that. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> And why so
I pray. <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Bicause if you should blab it
out, and it come vnto their eares, I should
loose no small part of my lyuing.<br />
<br /><b>So.</b>
Feare thou not, thou shalt speake it to a
stone. <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Harken hither in thine eare thẽ.
<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> A fonde wench, what needeth it to
lay mine eare to thine, seing we be alone?
except it were that God shoulde not heare
it. Oh lyuing God, I see thou art a religious
whore, thou doest thy charity vpon
Mendicants.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Mendicant Friers.</i></span>
<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Well, I get more by
these Mendicants &amp; simple beggers, than
by you riche folke.<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> So I thinke, they
spoyle and prowle from honest matrones
to cast at whores tayles.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> But tell on
your tale concerning the booke. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> I will
so doe, and better it is. Therein Paule
taught me a lessõ, who being indued with
the spirite of truth could not lie, that neyther
whores, nor whore haunters shall
inherite the kingdome of heauen. When
I had reade this, I beganne to consider
with my selfe in this wise. It is a small
thinge, which I looke to be heire of by my
father, and yet neuerthelesse rather I had
to shake hands with all wanton women,
then to be set beside that inheritance, how
muche more then doth it sit me on, to beware
y<sup>e</sup> my father in heaue doth not disinherite
me of that far more excellent inheritance,
for against mine earthly father,
which goeth about to disinherite me, or to
cast me off, the ciuill lawes doe offer a remedie,
but if God list to cast of, or disinherite,
there is no helpe at all. Wherevpon,
I foorthwith vtterlie forefended my selfe,
the vse and familiaritie of all euill disposed
women.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> That is if you be able to
lyue chaste.<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> It is a good parte of the
vertue of continencie, hartilie to couit and
desire the same, if it will not so bee, well,
the vttermost remedie is to take a Wife.
When I was come to Rome, I powred
out the hole sincke of my conscience into
the bosome of a certayne Frier penitentiarie,
who with many words, right wiselye
exhorted mee to puritie, and cleannesse
of minde and bodye, and vnto the deuout
reading of holie scripture, with oft prayer
&amp; sobernesse of life, for my penaunce he enioyned
me naught else, but that I shoulde
kneele on my knees before the high alter,
and say y<sup>e</sup> Psalme <i>Miserere mei deus</i>. And if
I had mony to giue in almoys vnto some
poore bodie a <i>Carolyne</i>. And wheras I meruayled
much, that for so many times, as
I hadde confessed my selfe to haue played
the brothell, he layed vppon me so small a
penaunce, hee aunswered me right pleasauntlye
thus. Sonne (quoth he) if thou
truely repent, if thou change thy conuersation,
I passe not on thy penance, but if
thou proceed stil therin, thy very lust it self
shal at the length bring thee to paine and
penaunce ynough I warrant thee, though
the Priest appointeth thee none, for example
loke vpon my selfe, whome thou seest
now, bleare eyed, palsey shaken, and crooked,
and in time paste I was euen such a
one as thou declarest thy selfe to be. Thus
loe haue I learned to leaue it.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Why
then for ought that I can see I haue loste
my <i>Sophronius</i>. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Nay rather thou hast
him safe, for before he was in deede loste,
as one which neyther loued thee nor hymselfe.
He now loueth thee with a true loue,
and thirsteth thy saluation.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> What
aduise you me then to doe, friende <i>Sophronius</i>?
<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> As soone as possible you may to
withdrawe your selfe from this kinde of
lyfe, you are yet but a girle (to speake off)
and the spot of your misdemeanour maye
be washed away. Either take an husband
(so doing we wyll contribute some thing
to preferre you) eyther else get you into
some godly Colledge or Monestery which
receyueth those that haue done amisse, vpon
promise of amendment, or at the leastwyse
departing from this place, betake
your selfe into the seruice of some vertuous
and well disposed Matrone. And to
which of these you liste to enclyne your
minde, I offer you my friendly helpe and
furtheraunce.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Now I besech you with
all my hart <i>Sophronie</i> looke about &amp; prouide
for me, I will follow your counsayle. <br />
<br /><b>So.</b>
But in the meane while conuey your selfe
from out of this place.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Alack so sone,
<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> Why not, rather this day than to morrow?
namely since lingering it is damage,
and delay is daungerous. <br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b> Whether
should I then repaire, where should I stay
my selfe? <br />
<br /><b>So.</b> You shall packe vp all your
apparell and Iewels, &amp; deliuer it vnto me
in the euening, my seruaunt shall closelye
carrie it, vnto a faithfull honest Matrone.
And within a while after, I will leade you
out, as it were to walke with me and you
shal secretly abide in that Matrons house,
at my charge, vntill I prouide for you:
And that time shall not bee long.<br />
<br /><b>Lu.</b>
Be it so my <i>Sophronius</i>, I betake
my selfe wholy vnto you.
<br />
<br /><b>So.</b> For so doing here-after, you shall
haue ioy.</p>
